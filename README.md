This repository was focused on developing a basic application that could create a Bluetooth connection.

This was done for two reasons:
1. Develop an understanding of the different functions and implementation methods so bluetooth functionality could be added at a later date.
2. Remove the unnecessary code bloat that would accompany a branch from our main repository
